	  		<h1>Hanger - An Icon of Fashion</h1>
	  		
	  		<p>Some historians believe President Thomas Jefferson invented a forerunner of the wooden clothes hanger. However, today's 
	  		most-used hanger, the shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was inspired by a coat hook that was invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New
	  		Britain, Connecticut. An employee of the Timberlake Wire and Novelty Company, Albert J. Parkhouse of Jackson, Michigan has 
	  		also been credited with the invention. The story goes that one morning in 1903, Parkhouse arrived to work to find that all coat
	  		hooks were taken. Annoyed, he took a piece of wire, bent it into the shape we would recognize today, and hung his coat. Also 
	  		credited is Christopher Cann in 1876 as an engineering student at Boston University.</p>
